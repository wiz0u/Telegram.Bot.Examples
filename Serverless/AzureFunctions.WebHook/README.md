# Azure Functions Example

## Requirements
- [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- Visual Studio 2019 with Azure development workload
- An Azure account with an active subscription


## Test bot locally

### Set a token
At first, you have to set your own token in the environment variable. For this, replace **<BotToken>** with the token that belongs to your bot.

#### Command prompt
```
set token=<BotToken>
```

#### PowerShell 
```
$Env:token = "<BotToken>"
```

### Ngrok
Install ngrock from this page [ngrok - download](https://ngrok.com/download).
Run your function. You might need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests.

and start ngrok on port 7071.

```
ngrok http 7071 
```

### Set Webhook
From ngrok you get an URL to your local server. Itâ€™s important to use the `https` one. You can post this url as form-data (key: url, value: https://yoursubdomain.ngrok.io/api/TelegramBot) to the telegram api.
https://api.telegram.org/botYourBotToken/setWebhook
Be aware of the **bot** prefix in front of your bot token in the URL.

Now your bot should answer with the text from every message you send to it.
